# HC2 IoT Sensor

## August 2019 - Novermber 2019

- [github](https://github.com/ec965/HC2_arduino_python)

I created fimrware libraries in Python (for Raspberry Pi) and Arduino to
interface with the industry standard Rotronics HC2 temperature and humidity
sensor. I also designed a prototype IoT network for the HC2 sensor (currently a
private repository). Connections include WiFi, Email, and LoRa.
