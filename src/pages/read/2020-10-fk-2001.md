# FK-2001

I found a [Focus FK-2001](https://deskthority.net/wiki/Focus_FK-2001) terminal
keyboard in the garage. My dad first used it in the 90's when he started
programming. It's honestly still pretty nice for being in storage for 10+ years.

Initially, to connect the 5 pin DIN cable to my modern computer, I used a 5 pin
DIN to PS/2 adapter and a PS/2 to USB adapter.

First things first, I took it apart and cleaned it throughly. I dusted out the
innards with an air duster and wiped down all the keycaps.

I found that some of the keys (space and left ctrl) seemed to be double
pressing. I desoldered and swapped the troublesome switches with working
switches.

I really like the beige retro color of tech from this time period. The switches
are Alps SKCM whites or a clone, I'm not entirely sure.

Since the adapter chain is bit unsightly, I decided to use a
[Pro-Micro](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12640) to adapt the keyboard to
use USB.

The pins of the original cable connector are labelled C, D, G, and V for clock,
data, ground, and voltage respectivley.

I connected these pins to the Pro-Micro's PD0, PD1, RAW, and GND, then I flashed
the Pro-Micro with
[Hasu's terminal keyboard converter](https://github.com/tmk/tmk_keyboard/tree/master/converter/ibmpc_usb).

**the setup**

Luckily, there was a hole in the back of the case that was just big enough for a
USB mini port so I didn't have to do any drilling.

I didn't have heat shrink at the time so I hotglued the wires for insulation and
stability (don't worry, I soldered them first).

I also used a stack of cardboard and electrical tape to support the Pro-Micro in
the case. Not the prettiest solution, but no one's going to see it inside the
case.
