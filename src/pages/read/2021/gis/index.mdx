# GIS is Split

## April 2021 - May 2021

- [github](https://github.com/ec965/GIS)

GIS is a split keyboard that uses low profile choc switches. The key layout
draws inspiration from the
[Sofle](https://github.com/josefadamcik/SofleKeyboard) keyboard.

I spend a lot of time in front of the computer so I made this keyboard to
improve my ergonomics. I was never able to fully switch over since I couldn't
get over the dip in my typing speed when adapting to a new layout.

Part of the reason for making a split keyboard was cost. With split layouts,
only one PCB design is required which can then be mirrored for the other half.

You may recognize the PCB art.
