My first introduction to the terminal was fall quarter of 2016 at UC Irvine in EECS 10.
EECS 10 is an intro to programming in C course and our instructor gave us two choices.
With my Windows Laptop, I could either use [Code Blocks](https://www.codeblocks.org/) or I could ssh into the University servers and write my homework with Vim.
I did try downloading Code Blocks but I couldn't understand the UI and lets be honest, it's kind of ugly and outdated.
So I fell into the allure of the remote server and made my first SSH connection with [PuTTY](https://www.putty.org/).

Now, I can't tell a story about the terminal without talking about Vim.
Vim is hard to learn.
For my first two years of using Vim, I didn't even use hjkl.
I didn't know about `set mouse=a`. 
I did all my navigation with the arrow keys which is honestly insane to think about now.
