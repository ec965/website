I cut my own hair today.
I've been cutting my own hair since 2020.
If you've seen me in person in the last two years, then you've probably seen my
self inflicted haircut.

I like being self sufficient.
It's nice not having to rely on another human for basic human needs.

To be honest, it started off looking pretty bad but now I think it looks passable.
It's nice to learn a new skill and slowly get better at it.
