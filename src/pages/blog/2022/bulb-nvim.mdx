_This is part of a series of blog posts on Fennel and Neovim.
You can find [part 1 (Researching Lispy Neovim)](/blog/2022/lispy-neovim) and
[part 2 (Using Neovim as a Fennel Compiler)](/blog/2022/using-neovim-as-a-fennel-compiler/) on this blog._

Well, I finally got around to making it.
I'm presenting [`bulb.nvim`](https://github.com/ec965/bulb.nvim), my own
Fennel Neovim plugin.
It's built on the foundation of the compile -> run cycle.

## `package.preload`

## Bootstrapping with Lua
