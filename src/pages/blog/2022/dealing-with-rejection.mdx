I've been dealing with rejection since the first girl I had a crush on.

[![Warning! feelings not mutual](https://preview.redd.it/zrefs6zcrtx91.png?width=640&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=18deca5f179280bf8af675624a3e78c57e3d4ec4)](https://www.reddit.com/r/PixelArt/comments/ylj4qu/warning_215x300_pixels_aseprite_me/)

This is my lock screen right now.
It's there to remind me not to get too caught up in my feelings.
So I don't get disappointed with rejection.
But don't be silly, its not just love.

<p style="margin:0;">Getting rejected from colleges.</p>
<p style="margin:0;">Getting rejected from internships.</p>
<p style="margin:0">Getting rejected at career fairs.</p>
<p style="margin:0">Getting rejected from job applications.</p>

I try not to set my expectations too high.
I lie to myself.
I tell myself, "It's not that important".
But dammit if I'm not feverishly praying with my subconscious that it all works out.
