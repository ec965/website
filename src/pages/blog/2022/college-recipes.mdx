A collection of recipes from my college days.
It's somewhat nostalgic to look back on these.
Some of these were written during the height of Bon Appetit and Binging with Babish's popularity on food YouTube.
Most of these recipes are adopted from other recipes I found online.
They are written on note cards, grocery receipts, and post it notes.
I still have all the physical copies but they're starting to fade and fall apart with time.
