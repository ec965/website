Maybe focus this more on levels of free form expressionism in art.

# Background

Messing around with painting, mixed mediums, and music in highschool and college.

- made a film w/ Alex
- link to "create" part of this site

It was all fairly juvenile, I don't think its very good.

# On Mediums and free form vs expressionism

Free form expressionism - Jackson Pollock - the most free form.
Rigid expressionism - Coding - creativity in solutions but there's usually a best way to do it.

Does coding count as being creative?
I think it's closer to a science.
Everything is rigid, there's not too much room to do Jackson Pollock type things.

# film

- free form: looking for shots, cinematography, improve acting, writing a script
- rigid: following a script, editing (usage of computer based tools)

# painting

- depends on the type, I prefer modern-ish art because there are no rules

# photography

- free form: finding the shot, creating prints (irl photoshop)
- rigid: developing film, editing on the computer (much more fine grained that flash and burn)

Taking a film photography class with Yubo at UCI.
Meeting him at the Reddit meetup.

# writing

- free form: playing with sentence structures and words, poetry - throw away the rules
- rigid: the english language, research papers

## Research papers

- rigid in being argumentative and backed by facts
- free form in the way the argument is presented.

Always okay at writing.
Ms. Kuy getting upset with me because she thought I wasn't trying in my senior year (senioritis).
Had fun writing a history research paper in highschool.
Research papers are fun to put together but they take way too much time
for me to have the patience to do it in my free time.
Proud of getting asked to use my essay as an example for future courses in my Engr-190w course.

# baking

- people say it's like a science but you can also go with a dash of vanilla and it'll be fine
  or better yet, a dash of tequila or whisky

# What do I do now?

Taking lots of climbing photos.
Now we make climbing videos.
